# Next Hour

Minute-by-minute rain forecast for the next hour, built the way the original Dark Sky did it:
track storms on live radar and project them forward to your exact location. Installable on
iPhone as a home-screen web app; see [How to add Next Hour to iPhone](How%20to%20add%20Next%20Hour%20to%20iPhone.txt).

## How it works

1. **Radar** — the last 60 minutes of NOAA NEXRAD base reflectivity (5-minute mosaic, ~1 km,
   clutter-filtered by the Iowa Environmental Mesonet), a 340 km box around you. Pixel
   colours are mapped back to exact dBZ with the N0Q palette (`data.js`).
2. **Cleaning** — echoes under 15 dBZ and isolated speckle are dropped; reflectivity is
   converted to rain rate with Marshall-Palmer (Z = 200R^1.6).
3. **Motion** — frames 15 minutes apart are matched block by block (correlation tracking,
   coarse-to-fine with sub-pixel fitting). Outlier vectors are removed and the rest are
   smoothed into a motion field (`nowcast.js`).
4. **Extrapolation** — from your location the app traces back along the motion field to see
   which rain arrives each minute. A neighbourhood that widens with lead time gives the
   probability and intensity.
5. **Self-check** — each update re-forecasts the latest radar frame from 30 minutes earlier
   and scores it, shown next to a "storms stand still" baseline.
6. **Beyond radar** — offshore or far from a radar site, the forecast blends toward the
   Open-Meteo / HRRR model, which also gives the temperature that picks rain or snow.

The same Open-Meteo request also supplies the 24-hour and 7-day forecasts (temperature,
chance of precipitation, wind and gusts).

Testing a location: `index.html?lat=39.0&lon=-97.0`.

## Limits

- Radar coverage is the lower 48 plus coastal waters (about 150–250 km offshore).
- Storms forming or dying within the hour are not predicted (same as the original
  Dark Sky nowcast).

## Alert server

`server/` runs on an Oracle Cloud Always Free Ubuntu VM. It reuses the app's own modules, so
alerts give the same answer as the app. Every 5 minutes it forecasts each subscriber's saved
places and last-known location and sends a push about 15 minutes before rain (at most once
per rain event per place). Install or update on the VM with:

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jlblan2/next-hour/main/server/install.sh | sudo bash
```

The VM pulls new commits from GitHub every 30 minutes. It also fetches each new U.S. Navy
(FNMOC) run from NOAA NOMADS hourly (`server/navy/fetch_navy.py`): NAVGEM and the Navy
WAVEWATCH III ensemble control member, 0-120 h, cut to 0-60N 130-50W, served to the app
at `/api/navy/*` for the wave map and the second-opinion card. For the Passage weather charts it
also fetches each GFS run (`server/passage/fetch_gfs.py`, NOMADS grib filter: 10 m wind, gusts,
pressure, rain rate, visibility, GFS-Wave height/period/direction; 17-47N 100-60W, 0.25 deg,
3-hourly to 168 h), served gzipped at `/api/passage/*` alongside the Navy run in the same layout. Status: `https://<server>/api/status`.
Tests: `node server/test.js`.
